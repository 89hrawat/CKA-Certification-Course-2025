## Introduction: Why Taints and Tolerations?  

In Kubernetes, **Taints and Tolerations** help **control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes**. They allow cluster administrators to **prevent certain workloads from running on specific nodes** while allowing exceptions when necessary.  

### **When Do We Need Taints & Tolerations?**  
Taints and tolerations are useful in several scenarios:  

| **Use Case** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Dedicated Nodes** | Taint nodes with a GPU to restrict them to **GPU-intensive workloads** only. |
| **Isolating Critical Workloads** | Ensure **critical workloads** run separately from **non-critical** ones. |
| **Preventing Scheduling on Control Plane Nodes** | Control plane nodes should only run **Kubernetes system workloads**. |
| **Maintenance Mode** | Taint a node under **maintenance** to stop new pods from being scheduled. |
| **Node Resource Constraints** | Prevent pods from being scheduled on nodes with **low memory or CPU**. |

### **Important:**  
Taints and tolerations **only apply during scheduling**. If a pod is already running on a node, adding a taint **will not remove the existing pod** (unless you use the **NoExecute** effect).  

---

## Understanding Taints  

A **Taint** is applied to a **node** to indicate that it **should not accept certain pods** unless they explicitly tolerate it.  

### **How to Apply a Taint?**  
Taints are applied to nodes using the following command:  
```sh
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
```
**Example:**  
```sh
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker storage=ssd:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker2 storage=hdd:NoSchedule
```
- These commands taint `my-second-cluster-worker` to **only allow pods that tolerate `storage=ssd:NoSchedule`** and `my-second-cluster-worker2` to **only allow pods that tolerate `storage=hdd:NoSchedule`**.  

---

### **Effects of a Taint**  

| **Effect** | **Behavior** |
|------------|-------------|
| **NoSchedule** | New pods will **not be scheduled** unless they have a matching toleration. |
| **PreferNoSchedule** | Kubernetes **tries** to avoid scheduling pods but **doesn‚Äôt enforce it strictly**. |
| **NoExecute** | Existing pods **without a matching toleration will be evicted** from the node. |

---

## Understanding Tolerations  

A **Toleration** is applied to a **pod**, allowing it to **bypass a node‚Äôs taint** and be scheduled on it.  

### **How to Apply a Toleration?**  
Tolerations are defined in a pod‚Äôs YAML under `spec.tolerations`:  

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "storage"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "ssd"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
- This **tolerates** nodes that have the taint `storage=ssd:NoSchedule`, allowing the pod to be scheduled on them.  
- The **Effect in the toleration must match the Effect in the taint** for it to take effect.  

---

### **Toleration Operators**  

| **Operator** | **Behavior** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Equal** (default) | The key and value **must exactly match** the taint. |
| **Exists** | Only the key needs to match, and the value is ignored. |

**Example using Exists:**  
```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "storage"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
- This toleration allows the pod to be scheduled on **any node that has a `storage` taint**, regardless of its value.  

---

## How Taints and Tolerations Work Together  

| **Node Taint** | **Pod Toleration** | **Effect** |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| `storage=ssd:NoSchedule` | **Toleration exists** | ‚úÖ Pod **can** be scheduled. |
| `storage=ssd:NoSchedule` | ‚ùå No toleration | ‚ùå Pod **cannot** be scheduled. |
| `storage=ssd:NoExecute` | **Toleration exists** | ‚úÖ Pod **remains** on the node. |
| `storage=ssd:NoExecute` | ‚ùå No toleration | ‚ùå Pod **is evicted** from the node. |

---

## Demonstration  

### **Applying Taints**  
```sh
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker storage=ssd:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker2 storage=hdd:NoSchedule
```

### **Verifying Taints**  
```sh
kubectl describe node my-second-cluster-worker | grep -i taint
kubectl describe node my-second-cluster-worker2 | grep -i taint
```

### **Checking Pod Behavior Without Tolerations**  
```sh
kubectl run mypod --image=nginx
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod mypod
```
- The pod **remains in Pending state** because it does **not tolerate any taint**.  

### **Scheduling Pods with Tolerations**  

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app1-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app1
    spec:
      tolerations:
        - key: storage
          operator: Equal
          value: ssd
          effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
```
- This deployment **will now schedule pods on `my-second-cluster-worker`**.  

### **Using the Exists Operator**  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
    - key: storage
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedule
```
- This **pod can be placed on either `my-second-cluster-worker` or `my-second-cluster-worker2`**.  

### **Applying Multiple Taints and Tolerations**  
```sh
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker env=prod:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes my-second-cluster-worker2 env=dev:NoSchedule
```

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: storage
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: env
    operator: Equal
    value: prod
    effect: NoSchedule
```
- This pod tolerates **any `storage` taint** and **only `env=prod:NoSchedule`**.  

---

## Key Takeaways  

- **Taints are applied to nodes**, **Tolerations are applied to pods**.  
- A **pod can only be scheduled** on a tainted node if it has a **matching toleration**.  
- **Three effects of taints:** `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, and `NoExecute`.  
- **Operator `Equal` (default)** requires an exact match, while **`Exists` ignores values**.  
- **Taints and tolerations work together** to control **pod placement and node access**.  

üöÄ **Mastering taints and tolerations is crucial for scheduling control in Kubernetes!**
